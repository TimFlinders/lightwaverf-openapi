#summary Controlling a boiler with the relay units

= Introduction =

I got frustrated waiting for boiler control to be available - after waiting a whole year for it, I gave up on that and started applying what already exists to my central heating system.

Follow this at your own risk - and anything that happens is not my responsibility...


= Details =

Central heating control units work on 240V AC - so be careful, below are the steps I followed to get boiler control with existing LightWaveRF units:

  # Bought LightWaveRF in-line relay
  # Switched off mains to the central heating.
  # Identified wiring to the thermostat for the central heating
  # Cut one of the wires to the thermostat, and wired it to either side of the relay
  # Fed central heating mains from the central heating 'chocolate block' to the lightwaverf relay.
  # Switched on mains to the central heating
  # Held down 'learn' on the relay
  # Sent the boiler on command from my android phone.

Now I can switch the heating on and off from anywhere, 

optionally - you could fit one side of the relay to bypass the thermostat (force-on) and once side to keep in line with the thermostat - then the relay commands would have the following meaning:

Open (or On)   : force heating on,
Close (or Off) : thermostatic normal heating,
Stop           : heating forced off.
